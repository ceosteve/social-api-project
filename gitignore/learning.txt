CRUD based applications
Creat posts
Read posts
Update posts
Delete posts


conventions for creating a CRUD based API applications

CREAT   =  POST = @app.post("/posts)
READ    =  GET = @app.get("/post/{id})
        =  GET = @app.get("/posts)
UPDATE  =  PUT/PATCH = @app.put("/posts/{id}")
DELETE  =  DELETE = @app.delete("/posts/{id}")

>  When creating a path operation, it must have a decorator, in this case
   the decorator is an instance created globally using the FASTPI class of the 
   fastapi module.

>  The path operation must also contain a HTTP method to send a CRUD based request
   to the API server. 

>  The path operation should also specify a specific path on the URL, which will be used
   to locate a particular resource on the server and perform the HTTP request on it.

>  The path operation function specifies what the API will do when a specific request 
   is sent to the server

> The path operation fucntion is a decorator. Ideally, it adds behavior to the path operation 
  function without changing the function itself and then returns a new function, just the way it
  would work in a normal python script. 


DATABASE
a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed and managed
we dont directly interact with the database, rather we use a database management system as the link between 
us and the database

Relationsl databases
  1. MYSQL
  2.POSTGRESQL
  3.ORACLE
  4.SQL SERVER

NoSQL databases
  1. MongoDB
  2.DynamoDB
  3.ORACLE
  4. SQL SERVER

SQL = Structured query language, language used to communicate with a database management system
In POSTGRESQL, installing the DMS automatically creates one instance which is a databse called posgres
This database is necessary since Postgres needs a name of a database to connect to

Tables 
used for different kinds of data
in relational databases, these tables need to be designed in the database in such a manner that they have
a relationship with each other

Databases have datatypes
for Postgres, the datatypes include
Numeric -  int, decimal, precision
text - varchar, text
bool - boolean
sequence - array

One primary key has to be defined in a table
each entry has to be unique for the data we store in tables within a databse
as long as it can identify each entry uniquely

Unique Constraint can be added to a column to ensure that each entry is unique and that there are no duplicates
Null Constraint can be used to ensure that   Postgres does not use Null if a column is left blank. Rather, 
it is ging to throw an error
